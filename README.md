# Bootstrap-portfolio
Portfolio  designed in HTML/CSS utilising bootstrap 


## Description
This portfolio has been designed to introduce myself and is a place that I can display the work I have completed during the first month of my web development bootcamp.

For this challenge, it was a requirement to make use of bootstrap components that we have covered in class, such as the navbar, jumbotron and cards. I have also added a bootstrap carousel to my portfolio.

In the future I would like to add more JavaScript to my portfolio to get better functionality.
